# Rangers Cards

Create and edit decks — it will even check the deck-building rules to keep you honest. You can also group together decks into campaigns to track your progress. The app can be used with local decks and/or campaigns, or you can link your RangersDB account to sync changes on the go.

* Edit and upgrade your decks, either offline or by linking your RangersDB account.
* Track scenario results and keep the campaign log up to date, either offline or by linking your RangersDB account.
* Use the advanced card search.
